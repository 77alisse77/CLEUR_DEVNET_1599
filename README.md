# Session Abstract

|Network automation and devices management has many paths and options. With so many APIs being available your network can quickly be as complex to manage with automation as it was with manual configurations. Evaluating the offerings of API vendors often goes past the technology itself. But, NAPALM (Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with Multivendor support) is helping to change that., a unified API makes it possible to share code between network devices and vendors. In this session we will explore how the network admins are using to manage servers, cloud and applications can be leveraged in the network to promote a NetDevOps ethos within our network teams.
